### Hey! I'm Alex 👋
I am a student, web enthusiast & computer aficionado based in Spain.

## 🏔️ Experience 
In web dev I have most experience with frontend development, primarily React & Vue.js. However for the past few years I have been focusing a lot more on backend development, primarily using TypeScript & exploring Python and the Django framework.

I've also been very involved in game development focusing on low-level programming using C++ & peeking into the world of advanced graphics using industry standard frameworks such as DirectX & OpenGL.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
At the time, i'm studying a Data Science and Mathematics degree! My current main project is trying to join my games and web dev skills, mainly by learning three.js.
