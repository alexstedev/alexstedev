## üèîÔ∏è My learning experience 
In web dev I have most experience with frontend development, I have worked extensively with HTML and CSS. At the moment, my efforts are directed towards learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). On the other hand, lately I have been focusing a lot more on backend development, primarily using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & exploring [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework.

I've also been very involved in game development focusing on low-level programming using [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/) & peeking into the world of advanced graphics using industry standard frameworks such as [DirectX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directx) & [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/). I also have experience in game development with [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) using the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library and [Unity](https://unity.com/es) as a game engine. 

## üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...
At the time, i'm studying a Data Science and Mathematics degree! My current main project is learning Java through game development, I am trying to build a comprehensive 2D RPG game with a linear story.
