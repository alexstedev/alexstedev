### 🏔️ My learning experience 
In web dev I have most experience with frontend development, I have worked extensively with HTML and CSS. At the moment, my efforts are directed towards learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). On the other hand, lately I have been focusing a lot more on backend development, primarily using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & exploring [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework.

Currently, I'm studying a Data Science and Mathematics degree!
