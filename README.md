### Hey! I'm Alex 👋
I am a student, web enthusiast & computer aficionado based in Spain.

## 🏔️ Experience 
In web dev I have most experience with frontend development, primarily [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). However, lately I have been focusing a lot more on backend development, primarily using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & exploring [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework.

I've also been very involved in game development focusing on low-level programming using [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/) & peeking into the world of advanced graphics using industry standard frameworks such as [DirectX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directx) & [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/).

## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
At the time, i'm studying a Data Science and Mathematics degree! My current main project is trying to join my games and web dev skills, mainly by learning [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
